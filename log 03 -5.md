# Learning Log

### 03/5/23

### Interview prep:

    -Prepare beforehand: Research the company and the position you're interviewing for, 
    and familiarize yourself with common front-end development concepts and technologies. 
    Practice answering common interview questions and prepare a few questions to ask the interviewer.

    -Highlight your strengths: Focus on the skills and experience you do have, and emphasize 
    how they align with the requirements of the position. Be honest about your limitations, 
    but also show that you are willing to learn and grow.

    -Be enthusiastic: Employers often value enthusiasm and a positive attitude over technical 
    skills. Show that you are excited about the opportunity to work for the company and learn new things.

    -Take your time: If you're feeling overwhelmed during the interview, take a deep breath and 
    take your time answering the questions. It's better to take a moment to gather your thoughts than 
    to give a rushed or incomplete answer.

    -Ask for feedback: After the interview, ask the interviewer for feedback on your performance.
    This can help you improve your skills and prepare for future interviews.

### If I get stuck:

    -Ask for clarification: If you're unsure about a question or don't understand what the interviewer
    is asking, it's okay to ask for clarification. This shows that you're engaged and interested in 
    understanding the question fully.

    -Admit you're not sure: If you're asked a question you don't know the answer to, it's better to
    be honest and admit that you're not sure. You can follow up by saying that you're willing to learn 
    and that you'll do your best to find the answer.

    -WALK and TALK through your thought process: If you're working through a problem or task and get
    stuck, try walking through your thought process out loud. This can show the interviewer how you 
    approach problems and help you identify where you may be getting stuck.

    -Offer a solution: If you're stuck on a problem or task, try offering a potential solution or 
    approach, even if you're not sure it's the right one. This can show the interviewer that you're 
    willing to take initiative and think critically.

    REMEMBER- I have to demonstrate that I have the elements the company is looking for as a Junior
    Developer.

### Demonstrate these elements

    -Strong foundation in front-end technologies: You should have a solid understanding of HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with popular front-end frameworks and libraries 
    such as React, Angular, or Vue.

    -Attention to detail: As a front-end developer, you will be responsible for creating visually
    appealing and user-friendly interfaces. It's important to have a good eye for design and 
    attention to detail in order to create high-quality work.

    -Problem-solving skills: As a developer, you will encounter problems and bugs that need to
    be solved. Being able to approach problems logically and creatively is an important skill for any developer.

    -Good communication skills: Front-end developers often work closely with designers and back-end
    developers. Being able to communicate effectively and collaborate with others is essential.

    -Willingness to learn: Technology is constantly evolving, and it's important for a Junior 
    Front End Developer to have a willingness to learn new skills and keep up with industry trends.

    -Strong work ethic: Finally, employers look for candidates who are hard-working and dependable.
    As a Junior Front End Developer, you'll be working on projects that require attention to detail
    and the ability to meet deadlines.
