### Interview prep:

    -Prepare beforehand: Research the company and the position you're interviewing for, and familiarize yourself with common front-end development concepts and technologies. Practice answering common interview questions and prepare a few questions to ask the interviewer.

    -Highlight your strengths: Focus on the skills and experience you do have, and emphasize how they align with the requirements of the position. Be honest about your limitations, but also show that you are willing to learn and grow.

    -Be enthusiastic: Employers often value enthusiasm and a positive attitude over technical skills. Show that you are excited about the opportunity to work for the company and learn new things.

    -Take your time: If you're feeling overwhelmed during the interview, take a deep breath and take your time answering the questions. It's better to take a moment to gather your thoughts than to give a rushed or incomplete answer.

    -Ask for feedback: After the interview, ask the interviewer for feedback on your performance. This can help you improve your skills and prepare for future interviews.

### If I get stuck:

    -Ask for clarification: If you're unsure about a question or don't understand what the interviewer is asking, it's okay to ask for clarification. This shows that you're engaged and interested in understanding the question fully.

    -Admit you're not sure: If you're asked a question you don't know the answer to, it's better to be honest and admit that you're not sure. You can follow up by saying that you're willing to learn and that you'll do your best to find the answer.

    -WALK and TALK through your thought process: If you're working through a problem or task and get stuck, try walking through your thought process out loud. This can show the interviewer how you approach problems and help you identify where you may be getting stuck.

    -Offer a solution: If you're stuck on a problem or task, try offering a potential solution or approach, even if you're not sure it's the right one. This can show the interviewer that you're willing to take initiative and think critically.

    REMEMBER- I have to demonstrate that I have the elements the company is looking for as a Junior Developer.
