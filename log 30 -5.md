### Dynamic Types  (any types)

let age: any = 25;

age = true;

age = "hello";

age = {name: "Luigi"};


(basically reverts back to what original JS is like!!!)

Can use if not sure what type of variable we will get in the future..
OR if we DO NEED to change the type.

let mixed: any[]
mixed.push(5);
mixed.push('mario);
mixed.push(true)

let ninja: {name: any, age: any};

ninja = {name: 'yoshi', age: 25}
