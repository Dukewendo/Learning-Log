### Interfaces

Allows us to enforce a structure for class or object. Doesnt get used to create new things- more like a blueprint to show what properties and methods and types are allowed in the class or object and what it can return.

interface IsPerson {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  speak(a: string): void;
  spend(a: number): number;
}

const me: IsPerson = {
  name: 'Tim',
  age: 45,
  speak(text: string): void {
    console.log(text);
  },
  spend(amount: number): number {
    console.log("I spent", amount);
    return amount
  }

}

const greetPerson =(person: Isperson) => {
  console.log('hello', person.name)
}


Every class or object that is created HAS to follow the IsPerson interface (or blueprint!)
